# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

This project explores machine learning techniques to predict used car prices based on various features such as mileage, fuel type, transmission and engine specifications.  
We compare **Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression and Polynomial Regression** to evaluate which model best captures the relationship between features and car prices.

---

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Goal:** Build a regression model to predict car prices accurately.  
- **Dataset:** Car features and corresponding prices (preprocessed with feature engineering).  
- **Models Implemented:**  
  - Linear Regression  
  - Lasso Regression  
  - Ridge Regression  
  - Polynomial Regression  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** R^2 Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).  

---

## 📈 Results
- **Polynomial Regression** achieved the highest R² score, showing strong predictive power.  
- However, the model may be prone to **overfitting**, so further improvements such as cross-validation, regularization or feature selection are recommended.  

---

## 🔍 Assumption Checks (Linear Regression)
To validate assumptions of Linear Regression, the following diagnostic plots were created:
1. **Linearity Check** – Scatter plot of residuals vs fitted values.  
2. **Homoscedasticity Check** – Residuals spread evenly across predictions.  
3. **Normality of Residuals** – Histogram plot of residual distribution.  

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Apply **cross-validation** for more reliable evaluation.  
- Tune hyperparameters for Ridge and Lasso.  
- Try **non-linear models** (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
- Deploy the best model for practical use.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **scikit-learn** (regression models, evaluation metrics)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis and visualization
